About Moneylang:

Money talks. That is all. (no jk)

Moneylang is designed to use only two characters -
'💰', and ' '.

Parsing is extremely contextual, and requires an
understanding of the rules of the language.

Each expression must start with a command. Commands can be found below:
Start - Starts the program syntax
End - Ends the program syntax
Define - Creates a new variable in the format <define><type><id><value>.
Update - Updates a value in the program in the format <id><op><val> 
Conditional - A basic if-statement. You can have nested if-statements. Format is <comparator><expr>

Keys:
<type> = The specified type of the variable.
<id> = The name of the variable.
<value> = The value of that variable relative to the type. (For example: strings and references can be interchanged)
<op> = Any valid computational operator. (=,+,-,*,/,%)
<comparator> = A comparison statement. (a > b)
<expr> An expression. It could be a Define, Update, or Conditional statement.

Moneybags are grouped together and seperated by spaces. 
A basic program that starts and ends can be defined by: '💰 💰💰💰💰💰💰'
